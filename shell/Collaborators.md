* Most of the code used was altered from the os-demos.
* Keeping track of the position you are in the command list was inspired by Juan Rincon.
* Through Alan Uribe's inspiration I was able to make realizations to reuse some code from redirects to use when piping.
* Alan also helped in deleting the redirection output `>` with `args = args[position]`.
